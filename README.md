This game was created as an example of a Twine game for a talk about game development at [the Northern Ireland Developer Conference](https://www.nidevconf.com/) in 2024. The following resources were used to create it:

- [Twine](https://twinery.org/), of course.
- The [SugarCube story format](https://www.motoslave.net/sugarcube/2/docs/)
- The [Twine Cookbook](https://twinery.org/cookbook/)
- [A Total Beginner's Guide To Twine](https://www.adamhammond.com/twineguide/)

A playable version of this game can be found [on Itchio](https://shinyemptyhead.itch.io/botanic-panic).

All photographs were taken by me, except [the closeup of Kelvin's statue](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Lord_Kelvin%27s_statue,_Belfast_(2013-1)_-_geograph.org.uk_-_3616053.jpg) and [the closeup of the sphinx on the museum](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:The_Ulster_Museum,_Belfast_(detail)_(1)_-_geograph.org.uk_-_363223.jpg), both of which came from Wikimedia Commons.

The amazing cover art for this game is by Dr Dubz. Check out his [linktree](https://linktr.ee/mightydubz) for details on his commissions and social media.
